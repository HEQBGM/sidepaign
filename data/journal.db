Tock produced a dubious deed to the Duck which most claim was forged but the deed was certified as genuine by Vamros Harg.

The nearest stands of pine, eyln, and darkwood—all typically sturdy woods—twist away from the cl earing, as if bent by some impossibly strong wind or seemingly in an attempt to flee despite their paralyzed roots. At the glade’s center squats an ugly cottage, little more than a pile of twigs, shoots, and ivy stacked upon mud walls. From the thatched roof dangle bundles of gnarled roots, old dried beast carcasses, and knucklebone bangles, all clattering together like gruesome wind chimes. A dozen small thatched fetishes—each shaped like a tiny man, imp, or rearing serpent—stand propped in the yard, keeping guard before a rickety plank door.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Years ago this cottage was home to the witch Ulizmila, a wise woman, practitioner of the old ways, and local boogieman. While some said she was a monstrous hag and great, great granddaughter of Baba Yaga herself, the deathless Witch Queen of the North, others knew her as a harsh but wise sage willing to share her wisdom for strange and often morbid prices. Although her works still spoil in this glen, Ulizmila is long since gone.</p>\n<p>This clearing is roughly 120 feet in diameter, with a dilapidated, circular, 15-foot cottage at its center. Fourteen unnerving but harmless 3-foot-tall scarecrow-like effigies are propped-up throughout the glade. Anyone who approaches the cottage can see that its moldering door has rotted off its hinges but still blocks the way within. Any character who makes a DC 14 Athletics check can easily heft aside the barrier.</p>\n<p>Inside, the cottage is dank, reeking, and filled with shadows. Haphazardly hung shelves line the walls, covered in all manner of clay jugs, clouded bottles, strangely cut rocks, rotted bunches of herbs, and a museum of other crude curios and remnants of a bone grinder’s artifice. A rusted iron cauldron, with a mouth nearly 5 feet wide and a depth of at least 3 feet, dominates the hut’s single room, its ash-covered surface shaped with a relief of capering fiends and leering devils. Across from the door, against the far walls, stands a highbacked chair made of wicker, the gigantic curved tusks of some monstrous beast, and thousands of human teeth. In the chair sits what looks like a corpse wrapped in filthy burial linens, its form padded with pungent herbs and sprouting patches of thick white mold. This ominous shape is actually only a bundle of branches, mud, and linen, left by Ulizmila to distract trespassers from her home’s actual guardian, her pet cauldron.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature: </strong>The cauldron in the cottage is a unique animated object.

A DC 14 Society check or merely inquiring with any of the families of the afflicted reveals that Laurel is aiding the families of the sick as best she can although her proscriptions are little more than bed rest and a pungent black urdroot tea. Nearly anyone in town can direct the PCs to Laurel’s shop, the unmistakably named Roots and Remedies. The line stemming from Laurel’s shop makes a useful first-time meeting place for unacquainted PCs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Roots and Remedies</strong></h3>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Creeping ivy and full window boxes cover the façade of the rugged-looking, two-story shop bearing the faded sign “Roots and Remedies.” A line of twenty-some somber townsfolk—some with pale, wheezing children, others seeming</em><em>to be precipitously near tears—stretches from </em><em>the open door.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Laurel’s shop has been besieged since the outbreak of blackscour taint, both by the afflicted and their families and by hypochondriacs of all stripes. While she tries to help those with legitimate concerns as best she can, she has no qualms in selling the deluded her most expensive balms.</p>\n<p>Unless the PCs attempt to bypass the line—an act that might touch off a small, hacking riot—it takes nearly an hour to reach the door of Roots and Remedies. Once inside, the clutter and disrepair of the shop shows the recent traffic, and Laurel visibly overworks herself at the store’s rear, brewing remedies for the ill.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>The smell of burnt earth and spicy incense chokes the air of the cramped, mud-tracked shop. Bunches of dried herbs hang from the ceiling, along with dangling pots, presses, alchemical apparatuses, and glassware of more arcane purposes. Pouches of rare plants, jars of colored glass, and all manner of dried, preserved, and jellied animal parts fill high shelves and tables doing double duty as displays and workspaces. In the shop’s rear, a rail-thin woman with severe-l ooking spectacles and hair pulled back tightly busies herself between an overpacked rack of herbs, a table covered in stray powders and measuring equipment, and a pot loudly bubbling over with thick gray froth. Over the din of her work and without looking up, the woman impatiently shouts, “And what’s your problem?”</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The PCs are free to converse with Laurel as they please and she can tell them anything they need to know about the blackscour outbreak, how many people are afflicted, and—especially—how it’s not her job to treat every cut and scabbed knee the daft people of Falcon’s Hollow come crying to her about.</p>\n<p>Initially dismissive if the PCs don’t present themselves as customers or capable assistants, she eventually comes around and tells the PCs what she knows about the taint. Even if the PCs seem honestly w illing to help, she might not even think to mention the untried medicine until the caharacters are about to walk out the door, calling them back at the last moment.</p>\n<p>While conversing with Laurel, she answers some of the most likely questions as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>What is blackscour?</strong> “Just a fungus that’s not good for anything. Hard, bitter, and sharp, it likes the water and gets you sick if you drink it down. Never heard of it gorowing around these parts, though, until now.”</p>\n<p><strong>What is blackscour taint?</strong> “It’s a sickness, almost like any other, but you get the mold growing in you. It starts eating away in your chest and belly and is damned determined to stay. Your body near turns itself insideout trying to hack the stuff up, but all that does is cuts your guts up… bad.”</p>\n<p><strong>How many townsfolk have blackscour taint?</strong> “More than thirty, honestly, though at least three times that thinks they’ve got it.”</p>\n<p><strong>Is there any cure?</strong> “Not around here. I’ll get these folks what I can and we’ll see what good it does.”</p>\n<p><strong>There’s another medicine?</strong> “My grandmother’s book has a brew in it that says its good for this kind of thing. A weird concoction that sounds more like hoojoo than real medicine.”</p>\n<p><strong>What’s in this medicine?</strong> “Some rare roots and concentrations, most of which I have here, but there’s three I don’t. Elderwood moss, which I’ve never heard of, but granny says the stuff only grows on the oldest tree in a forest. A specially pickled root called rat’s tail, again, sounds like hoojoo to me. And seven ironbloom mushrooms, stunty little things that only grow in dark places thick with metal, a favorite among dwarves, or so I hear.”</p>\n<p><strong>Do you know where we could find these ingredients?</strong> “Well, for the elderwood mold, there’s gotta be an oldest tree in the vale. Damned if I know where it is, though.</p>\n<p>“The rat’s tail and mushrooms are even longer shots. Way north, toward the mountains, people say there used to live a bunch of dwarves. They’re not there anymore, but I’d bet their forges are. If you can find ironbloom anywhere around here, that’d be your best bet.</p>\n<p>“As for the rat’s tail, who knows? Well. Actually. Ulizmila, the witch that lives deep in the woods might. She’s a crafty, mean thing that knows all sorts of strangeness.  She might even have one. I don’t know what she might want for it, but I doubt it’d come cheap. My grandmother traded her sight to the old crone for a few pages of what she knew, and that was years and years back, and I don’t know a soul who got any nicer as they got older.”</p>\n<p><strong>How much time do we have to get the ingredients?</strong> “None! Folks are dying every day! All we can hope to do now is treat who we can and hope to save the gravedigger some work.”</p>\n<p><strong>Can you pay us for finding these ingredients?</strong> [Outraged] “Pay you!? I’ll pay you in…! Well, I suppose I’m not doing all this for free either. If nothing else, this whole thing’s been good for business. How about this, you come back with everything I need to brew the medicine and I’ll cut you in: 3 gold each. Fair?”</p>\n<p>She can be bargained up to 5 gp each with a successful DC 16 Diplomacy check.</p>\n<p>Although Laurel has an idea of where the ingredients for her medicine might be found, she’s never set foot beyond the fringes of Darkmoon Vale and honestly has no idea where the locations she mentions are. If the PCs seem committed to searching, she suggests they head to the Consortium Lumber Camp to the east and look for Milon Rhoddam—the most experienced woodsman in the Lumber Consortium.</p>","folder":"NkAAxaTTFI1ajkJ4","sort":600000,"permission":{"default":0,"4yCBDF9see6CSU03":3},"flags":{}}

Approaching the Ruins (MD)</h2>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Sitting squat at the foot of an imposing mountain, a ruined monastery comes into view between ancient gnarled trees. Made of simple stone blocks, worn smooth with the passage of time, the stout building is falling apart. Sections of the slanted shale roof have collapsed and portions of the outer wall have crumbled.

Before entering the yard, the path passes between a pair of old stone statues. While one of them is little more than rubble, the other is relatively intact. The 5-foot- tall statue is incredibly worn but it can still be made out as a dwarf holding aloft a great stone hammer. Moss and creeper vines cover most of its surface. Removing the vines around the base uncovers an old dwarven inscription that reads “All praise, [this part is defaced].” Unfortunately, the missing name was scratched off a long time ago and is no longer legible.

{"_id":"rkJxPeKodOpkVNEq","name":"Part 2: Darkmoon Vale","content":"<h2>PART 2: DARKMOON VALE</h2>\n<p>The PCs should be compelled to plot their own journey to and through Darkmoon Vale, choosing their path as they see fit. Unless a PC rolls high on a Nature or Society check, it’s likely they’ll need to make a stop at the Lumber Consortium’s main camp (see @JournalEntry[1WdL85tYTSz7QtTi]{Mapping the Vale}).</p>\n<p>The entire journey, from Falcon’s Hollow to the lumber camp, to various forest locations and on to the old dwarven ruins, is just over 37 miles in length. Assuming the group moves at a speed of 25, the entire journey takes a little more than three days, plus any time spent exploring or days spent resting. This time increases to five days if the group’s speed is 20. Crossing the water on the return trip cuts it down to only 22 miles but requires a treacherous swim or the construction of a crude raft. While the PCs are exploring the vale, roll on @RollTable[TImGkBoM8L4gUdoF]{Random Encounters in Darkmoon Vale} generate a random encounter once per day.</p>\n<p><strong>1. Foul Tracks:</strong> A DC 17 Perception/Survival check reveals a set of deep, goat-like tracks. A character with Survival can determine that whatever made these depressions walks upright, and can easily follow them. The tracks only persist for approximately 50 feet before mysteriously disappearing.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Dead Fey:</strong> The PCs happen upon a dead tree streaked with multicolored fairy blood. Three sprite-like creatures, known as keld piskies, are pinned here, their exsanguinated bodies turned to gnarled wood. A DC 16 Nature check identifies these creatures, while a DC 15 Society check recalls dubious stories about fairy blood being used to turn lead into gold.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Woodsmen:</strong> Three inexpert and slightly drunk human hunters travel the forest, trapping rabbits and tracking larger game, specifically dunlied (see @JournalEntry[Dw4uEWTV8WiU5HoN]{Forest Fauna}). If the PCs get lost or are looking for directions, these woodsmen can point them back to their path with somewhat questionable expertise.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Glowmold:</strong> The undersides of several large rocks deep in the forest are covered in rare, glowing mold. A character who makes a DC 16 Survival check can harvest enough of the mold without destroying it to serve as a light source. Once removed from the rock, the mold continues to glow with the brightness of a torch for 3 days.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Wyvern Sighting:</strong> Any character who makes a DC 18 Perception check notices an ominous shadow and looks up quickly enough to see a hunting blue wyvern soar low over the tree tops. Unless the PCs specifically (and especially loudly) attempt to attract its attention, the wyvern does not notice them.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Kobold Shaman:</strong> Kolmokmurk was the former shaman of the kobolds who now lair beneath the dwarven monastery. He was exiled after he drank a potion that killed him and animated him as a zombie. The zombie kobold now wanders the forest, thoughtless and aimless, attended by Creeper, his dutiful rat familiar (who now lives in his skull). He wears a crude wood sign bearing the word “shaman” in Draconic.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Giant Mosquito:</strong> A giant mosquito (with the same stats as a stirge) crosses the path of the PCs and attempts to soundlessly attach itself to the character walking in the rear. The disgusting insect flees if it takes any damage.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Hunter’s Snare: </strong>Grung Knifetongue (see @JournalEntry[PN3XyAqp1Zh8AYcO]{B: Bait}) laid a number of dangerous traps about the woods. Along an overgrown deer trail, he set a camouflaged pit trap (see @Actor[Bc21NxgBkIKBUQlk]{Hidden Pit}), covered in leaves and supporting the form of a dead rabbit.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Giant Moorsnake:</strong> An ophidian predator crosses the path of the PCs (same stats as a constrictor snake). During the day, the moorsnake is too lethargic to attack and merely slithers away. At night, though, it might slip into camp and attempt to constrict a sleeping PC.</p>\n<p><strong>10. Wolves: </strong>Two wolves in the service of Graypelt (see Part 3) patrol the far reaches of their master’s claimed territory. They viciously attack the PCs on sight, but both flee if either is reduced to fewer than half hit points, returning to the monastery to inform their worg master.</p>","folder":"NkAAxaTTFI1ajkJ4","sort":800000,"permission":{"default":0,"4yCBDF9see6CSU03":3},"flags":{}}
