Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:22.842-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EnZ6Ev1ioEPkXkvt":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}}},{"_id":"ava5f9xcofmvmwqi","name":"Hunt Prey","type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/features/classes/hunt-prey.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you focus your attention on a single foe, you become unstoppable in your pursuit.

You can ignore the effects of non-magical difficult terrain. As normal for ignoring difficult terrain, this also lets you treat the hindrances of greater difficult terrain as those of difficult terrain.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead.

Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to master. When wearing light or medium armor, you can rest normally, rather than receiving poor rest that leaves you fatigued.</p>\n<h2>Swift Prey<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You size up your prey with only a glance. You can use Hunt Prey as a free action if it's your first action of your turn.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"ranger","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:23.617-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"07lzm":{"id":"RVZC4wVy5B5W2OeS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/masterful-hunter.webp","level":"17","name":"Masterful

The GM will likely reduce how long you can continue at the task.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You earn nothing for your work and are fired immediately. You can't continue at the task.

It's usually easy to find work making basic items whose level is 1 or 2 below your settlement's level. Higher-level tasks represent special commissions, which might require you to Craft a specific item using the Craft downtime activity and sell it to a buyer at full price. These opportunities don't occur as often and might have special requirements-or serious consequences if you disappoint a prominent client.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Practicing a Trade [Lore]</h2>\n<p>You apply the practical benefits of one of your Lore specialties during downtime by practicing your trade. This is most effective for Lore specialties such as business, law, or sailing, where there's high demand for workers. The GM might increase the DC or determine only low-level tasks are available if you're attempting to use an obscure Lore skill to Earn Income. You might also need specialized tools to accept a job, like mining tools to work in a mine or a merchant's scale to buy and sell valuables in a market.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Staging a Performance [Performance]</h2>\n<p>You perform for an audience to make money. The available audiences determine the level of your task, since more discerning audiences are harder to impress but provide a bigger payout. The GM determines the task level based on the audiences available. Performing for a typical audience of commoners on the street is a level 0 task, but a performance for a group of artisans with more refined tastes might be a 2nd- or 3rd-level task, and ones for merchants, nobility, and royalty are increasingly higher level. Your degree of success determines whether you moved your audience and whether you were rewarded with applause or rotten fruit.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["skill","downtime"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"earn-income","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:16.651-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"weapon":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":""},"requirements":{"value":""},"trigger":{"value":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"EnZ6Ev1ioEPkXkvt":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.QyzlsLrqM0EEwd7j"}}},{"_id":"46sbzj4CLgMrPMcO","name":"Disarm","type":"action","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/actions/OneAction.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have at least one hand free.

As much as 15 feet long and weighing up to 1,000 pounds, a wyvern's resilient body allows it to crash talons-first into large prey without serious risk to itself. A wyvern uses its momentum to stun its target before injecting it with searing venom or carrying it over the side of a nearby cliff. Because a wyvern lacks the strength to haul its prey all the way to its nest intact, it is far more likely to lift and drop its victim over a gully or canyon and let gravity do its work before it descends to pick apart the carcass.<br /><br /> Conversation is of little interest to a wyvern, as the creature typically speaks only to taunt its prey, issue territorial claims, or demand tribute. Even so, many wyverns enjoy grim humor and tales of violent acts, particularly if those acts were committed by the storyteller. A wyvern properly appeased with meat, entertainment, and treasure sometimes agrees to provide assistance ranging from giving directions to serving as a mount for a powerful humanoid. However, these arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks before the wyvern's pride, malice, or insolence inspires it to flee or even betray its allies. Only the truly cruel can cow a wyvern into servitude for an extended period, as most wyverns are so self-interested that they go out of their way to avoid helping others.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"}},"traits":{"size":{"value":"lg"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["paralyzed","unconscious"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:55.859-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}}},"token":{"actorId":"wuaSG22lLjQ6yali","actorLink":false,"alpha":1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":20,"displayName":20,"disposition":-1,"flags":{},"height":2,"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/npc.svg","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":0,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"name":"Wyvern","randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":0,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":2},"items":[{"_id":"s5DYWIxSytUTy1x2","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:55.859-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"7erb2kw38fpwxhwon5hv":{"damage":"2d12+5","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":17},"attackEffects":{"value":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Fangs","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"Ptn3Zb1Syk7YdL4y","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:55.859-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"lcwldz6jeqddoylsq1zx":{"damage":"2d8+5","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":17},"attackEffects":{"value":["Grab"]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Claw","sort":200000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"SPTwJf1wzeADk4sn","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","reach-10"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:55.859-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"crn2lrrh68exgyi0ieuv":{"damage":"2d6+5","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":15},"attackEffects":{"value":["wyvern venom"]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Stinger","sort":300000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"ke061cBViYyPq54H","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using. <strong>Effect</strong> The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature.

Distant relatives of true dragons, tatzlwyrms possess only a meager level of intelligence. They can speak Draconic (with a thick, hissing accent), but their ability to reason is limited and they can't use magic. They do possess a level of cunning, however, and some have been known to build rudimentary traps and even lairs. They are not treasure-hoarders, though, so don't expect to find a tatzlwyrm sitting atop a bed of coins.<br /><br /> Some tatzlwyrms have managed to forge working relationships with dragons, though it's a rare occurrence. From time to time, dragons have used them as messengers (because they can speak their language, however crudely), scouts (due to their smaller size), guides (when they're familiar with a particular mountain), and even muscle (harassing foes not worthy of a dragon's direct attention).<br /><br /> Tatzlwyrms don't work with kobolds, though-tatzlwyrms eat kobolds.<br /><br /> Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable occasion, townsfolk reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle.<br /><br /> When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face. Since this breath attack doesn't have much range, the wyrms usually need to grab their foes first and bring them close to their mouth.<br /><br />","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"}},"traits":{"size":{"value":"med"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["dragon"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["draconic"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":["paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:43.342-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}}},"token":{"actorId":"UnWr8QSMq2VZUQhX","actorLink":false,"alpha":1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":20,"displayName":20,"disposition":-1,"flags":{"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null}},"height":1,"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f5bbd5291cf594ec908fc5d/hector%27s%20shit/TatzlwyrmToken.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":0,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"name":"Tatzlwyrm","randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":0,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1,"lightColor":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"Cp1loMnqFXw0uGPS","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magical"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:43.342-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"v7p77lwh03ak998z4u6s":{"damage":"1d8+6","damageType":"piercing"}},"bonus":{"value":10},"attackEffects":{"value":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Jaws","sort":100000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"NSdZME2VBfcmBDQA","data":{"description":{"value":"","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","magical"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:43.342-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"weaponType":{"value":"melee"},"attack":{"value":""},"damageRolls":{"gbzrbxx68fk0yt89gjka":{"damage":"1d6+6","damageType":"slashing"}},"bonus":{"value":10},"attackEffects":{"value":[]}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/default-icons/mystery-man.svg","name":"Claw","sort":200000,"type":"melee","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"FKgN8Ya6AS8vCOry","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A monster with darkvision can see perfectly well in areas of darkness and dim light, though such vision is in black and white only.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":null,"lastMigration":null},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"bL4m8T94kYDMr79h":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}}},{"_id":"r7apqcgma9syccy0","name":"Shield Block (Level 1)","type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/features/classes/shield-block.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["champion","druid","fighter"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"shield-block-level-1","schema":{"version":null,"lastMigration":null},"level":{"value":1},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":""},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"0fr43nklibxmkcb7"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"bL4m8T94kYDMr79h":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.eZNCckLzbH3GyncH"}}},{"_id":"xn4wxhxg8lbobr27","name":"Deity and Cause","type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/features/classes/deity-and-cause.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Champions are divine servants of a deity.

Hobgoblins are singularly devoted to war, and their entire culture is built upon fostering and maintaining conflict while simultaneously proving their superiority in battle. Hobgoblins are highly organized, and they work efficiently and effectively in groups, whether that group is a small raiding party, a roving war band, or a fully regimented army. Hobgoblin rulers require little provocation before declaring war, and more often than not, such wars are waged to gain slaves or territory. Physically, hobgoblins stand about as tall as humans and have gray, ashen skin.</p>\n<p>Hobgoblin society is organized along military lines, and every hobgoblin is effectively a member of the army. Each hobgoblin in a community has a rank in the military hierarchy, and individuals are naturally ambitious and obsessed with advancement. Hobgoblins are constantly expected to prove that they're fearless, ruthless, cunning, and strong. Demonstrating such aptitudes is an individual hobgoblin's best hope for promotion through the ranks, but failure leads only to cruel exploitation at the hands of their superiors. Though brutal, hobgoblin society is a true meritocracy, and all hobgoblins, regardless of age, gender, or birth, wield authority and earn respect from their peers based on their skill in battle. Even those individuals who serve in non-combat roles in hobgoblin society-blacksmiths, builders, cooks, messengers, quartermasters, and the like-know that they perform vital jobs that support the larger hobgoblin army, though they rarely rise above the rank of common soldier. Everyone contributes to the larger whole, ensuring that hobgoblin society is the strongest and most efficient it can be, and anyone who fails to do so is culled from the army and this hobgoblin society as dead weight. Hobgoblins don't usually engage in trade with other races, or even with other hobgoblin tribes, preferring to take what they want by force.</p>","flavourText":"","heritage":{"value":""},"keyability":{"value":"str"}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""}},"traits":{"size":{"value":"med"},"senses":{"value":"darkvision"},"traits":{"value":["goblin","humanoid"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","goblin"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}}},"token":{"actorId":"PiZkpRK23u89h82S","actorLink":false,"alpha":1,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"brightLight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"dimSight":0,"displayBars":20,"displayName":20,"disposition":-1,"flags":{"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null}},"height":1,"img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/5f5bbd5291cf594ec908fc5d/hector%27s%20shit/HobgoblinSoldierToken.webp","lightAlpha":1,"lightAngle":0,"lightAnimation":{"intensity":5,"speed":5},"lockRotation":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"name":"Hobgoblin Soldier","randomImg":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"sightAngle":0,"tint":null,"vision":false,"width":1,"lightColor":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"q8LFpzrsOWhaovPE","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Longswords can be one‑edged or two‑edged swords.

You gain the Flurry of Blows action.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.nbfNETdpee8CVM17]{Flurry of Blows} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">A</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Make two unarmed Strikes. If both hit the same creature, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Apply your multiple attack penalty to the Strikes normally. As it has the flourish trait, you can use Flurry of Blows only once per turn.</p>\n<h2>Ki Spells</h2>\n<p>By tapping into a supernatural inner reserve called ki, you can create magical effects. Certain feats grant you special spells called ki spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first ki spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus} activity to meditate in order to reach inner peace.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<p>When you first gain a ki spell, decide whether your ki spells are divine or occult spells. You are trained in spell attack rolls and spell DCs of that tradition, and your key spellcasting ability is Wisdom.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies representing your basic training, which are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Monk Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a monk class feat.</p>\n<h2>Powerful Fist</h2>\n<p>You know how to wield your fists as deadly weapons. The damage die for your fist increases to 1d6 instead of 1d4. Most people take a -2 circumstance penalty when making a lethal attack with nonlethal unarmed attacks, because they find it hard to use their fists with deadly force. You don't take this penalty when making a lethal attack with your fist or any other unarmed attacks.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Movement<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You move like the wind. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed whenever you're not wearing armor. The bonus increases by 5 feet for every 4 levels you have beyond 3rd.</p>\n<h2>Mystic Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Focusing your will into your physical attacks imbues them with mystical energy. Your unarmed attacks become magical, allowing them to get past resistances to non-magical attacks. However, you still need an item such as @Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO]{Handwraps of Mighty Blows (+1)} to gain an item bonus to attack rolls or increase your attacks' weapon damage dice.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced martial arts and have now surpassed your former skill. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple weapons increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Path to Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You have progressed along your own path to enlightenment. Choose your Fortitude, Reflex, or Will saving throw. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. When you roll a success on the chosen saving throw, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Metal Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You can adjust your body to make unarmed attacks infused with the mystic energy of rare metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron and silver. This allows you to deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</p>\n<h2>Monk Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to expert. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for spell attacks and spell DCs with the tradition of magic you use for your ki spells increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Second Path to Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to find perfection in every success. Choose a different saving throw than the one you chose for your path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen saving throw increases to master. If you roll a success with the chosen saving throw, you instead critically succeed.</p>\n<h2>Graceful Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You move with perpetual grace in battle, eluding and turning aside blows. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Master Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You have honed your skill in using your body as a weapon. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks and simple weapons increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Third Path to Perfection<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You have made great progress in your personal studies of enlightenment. Choose one of the saving throws you selected for path to perfection or second path to perfection. Your proficiency rank for the chosen type of save increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on the chosen type of save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on the chosen type of save against an effect that deals damage, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Adamantine Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>When you focus your will into your limbs, your blows are as unyielding as the hardest of metals. Your unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine.</p>\n<h2>Graceful Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your sublime movement grants you unparalleled protection and offense. Your proficiency rank for unarmored defense increases to legendary, and your proficiency rank for your monk class DC increases to master. If you have ki spells, your proficiency rank for spell attack rolls and spell DCs with the tradition of magic you use for your ki spells increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Perfected Form<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You have purged incompetence from your techniques. On your first Strike of your turn, if you roll lower than 10, you can treat the attack roll as a 10. This is a fortune effect.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"monk","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:23.613-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"1fw9s":{"id":"D2AE8RfMlZ3D1FuV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/mystic-strikes.webp","level":3,"name":"Mystic

Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea. Human characters can be any of these ethnicities, regardless of what lands they call home.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Characters of human ethnicities in the Inner Sea region speak Common (also known as Taldane), and some ethnicities grant access to an uncommon language.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["human","humanoid"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"human","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:22.842-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":1,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"KIwV5H1JfjRzcUlJ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX"}}},{"_id":"3u0lZCvH80qoWbTg","name":"Lengthy Diversion","type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/features/feats/feats.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>When you critically succeed to Create a Diversion, you continue to remain hidden after the end of your turn.

Outside of Darkmoon Vale, Idris is a marksman without rival, that is certain. It is known that Idris began his career as one of the founding members of Fangwatch. Yet, early on, Idris had a falling out with Rutho Steiggerson and so left to join up with the Azure Guard, an adventuring party that had recently arrived within the Western Baronies. After one successful quest with the Guard however, Idris met @Actor[VbmINnyHtgV35X0g]{Kitani Eavewalker} and gave up adventuring for a period to be wedded to his Half-Elven beauty.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Idris spent several years with Kitani in Falcon's Hollow, where they lived quite happily and even had a child, @Actor[2hLITTZktF0gtUJg]{Kimi Eavewalker}. In time however, Idris returned to the adventurers life, this time striking out on his own. He began by taking commissions here and there and developed a reputation for getting the job done. If many of his employers often found Idris to be cold and aloof, they also knew him to be possessed of a cold efficiency. As the years went buy, Idris&rsquo;s legend grew and while his name has achieved great renown, few actually know anything about the man behind the name.</div>\n</div>"},"traits":{"size":{"value":"med"},"senses":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["elf","humanoid"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"schema":{"version":{"value":""},"lastMigration":null}},"token":{"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"displayName":20,"displayBars":20,"name":"Idris Eavewalker","height":1,"width":1,"disposition":-1,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":0.25,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/npc.svg"},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":"23WNikiTkcewBKmB","sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"4yCBDF9see6CSU03":3},"flags":{"pf2e":{"rollOptions":{"all":{"target:flatFooted":false}}}}}

You can cast spells using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.aBQ8ajvEBByv45yz]{Cast a Spell} activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Your unconventional access to this divine power means you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don't need to use a material component pouch when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can cast up to two 1st-level spells per day. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as an oracle, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest level of spells you can cast, as shown on Table 2-3: Oracle Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. To cast a heightened spell, you must have the heightened version in your repertoire; for example, you can't cast a 3rd-level version of a spell that is only in your repertoire at 1st level. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as an oracle. For example, as a 1st-level oracle, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level oracle, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your oracular class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Spell Repetoire</h2>\n<p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and five cantrips of your choice. You choose these from the common spells from the divine spell list, or from other divine spells to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level.</p>\n<p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Table 2-3), you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell; at 3rd level, you select two 2nd-level spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-level version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p>\n<p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></p>\n<p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p>\n<h2>Mystery</h2>\n<p>An oracle wields divine power, but not from a single divine being. This power could come from a potent concept or ideal, the attention of multiple divine entities whose areas of concern all touch on that subject, or a direct and dangerous conduit to raw divine power. This is the oracle's mystery, a source of divine magic not beholden to any deity.</p>\n<p>Choose the mystery that empowers your magic. Your mystery grants you special spells called revelation spells and might later grant you divine domain spells. It dictates the effects of your oracular curse, adds an additional cantrip to your repertoire, and gives you one or more trained skills. Drawing insight and power from the collective divine influences that fuel your magic also provides you with a special benefit.</p>\n<p>The following oracle mysteries are presented in this book.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qvRlih3u7vK3FYUR]{Ancestors Mystery}: Voices of past generations teach and haunt you.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gjOGOR30Czpnx3tM]{Battle Mystery}: You embody the virtues upheld by heroes of legend.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.IaxmCkdsPlA52spu]{Bones Mystery}: Death always seems near, and the dead speak to you.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RI2EMRBBPNSoTJXu]{Cosmos Mystery}: You draw power from the stars and the spaces between.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.GTSvbFb36InvuH0w]{Flames Mystery}: You dance with fire and do your best to remain unscorched by it.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.o1gGG36wpn9mxeop]{Life Mystery}: The teeming energies of life flow through you out into the world.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.tZBb3Kh4nJcNoUFI]{Lore Mystery}: You gain access to unparalleled, overwhelming knowledge.</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.W9cF7wZztLDb1WGY]{Tempest Mystery}: Wind, waves, and storms rage at your beck and call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Revelation Spells</strong></p>\n<p>The powers of your mystery manifest in the form of revelation spells, which are a type of focus spell. Casting a revelation spell costs 1 Focus Point and increases the effects of your oracular curse. You start with a focus pool of 2 Focus Points. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.OSefkMgojBLqmRDh]{Refocus}activity to reconcile the conflicting or unconventional nature of your divine mystery.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p>\n<p>Revelation spells have the cursebound trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means they increase the severity of your oracular curse (see below) when cast. You can't cast a cursebound spell if you don't have an oracular curse.</p>\n<p>You learn two revelation spells at 1st level. The first is an initial revelation spell determined by your mystery. The second is an initial domain spell you select from one of the domains associated with your mystery, which you cast as a revelation spell, causing it to gain the cursebound trait.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracular Curse</strong></p>\n<p>Drawing on multiple disparate sources of power inevitably places an incredible stress on your body, manifesting as a supernatural curse. The more revelation spells you cast, the worse the effects of your curse, but these increasingly conflicting energies can also provide you with divine benefits.</p>\n<p>The specific effects of your curse are tied to your mystery, but all curses follow the same progression. A curse continually gives you a mild but constant reminder that you carry otherworldly power. As you cast revelation spells, your curse intensifies, first to a minor effect and then to a moderate effect.</p>\n<p>Your curse progresses to its minor stage the first time you finish casting a revelation spell after your daily preparations. Once your minor curse has manifested, it remains in effect until you rest for 8 hours and again make your daily preparations. If you cast a revelation spell while your minor curse is in effect, you progress to the moderate curse effect immediately after you finish Casting the Spell. The minor effect continues to affect you, though some moderate curse effects might alter the specifics of your minor curse. At higher levels, you can cast more revelation spells, progressing your curse to its major stage and then an extreme stage; these stronger curses are cumulative with the effects of the lower stages and can alter them. When you Refocus while under the effects of your moderate or stronger curse, you reduce your curse's severity to minor in addition to regaining a Focus Point.</p>\n<p>Drawing upon your mystery's power while your curse is at its worst causes an irreconcilable conflict between you and the sources of your power. Immediately after casting a revelation spell while under the moderate effect of your curse, you are overwhelmed. While overwhelmed, you can't Cast or Sustain any revelation spells-you effectively lose access to those spells. You can still Refocus to reduce the effects of your curse and regain a Focus Point, but doing so doesn't allow you to cast further revelation spells. These effects last until you rest for 8 hours and make your daily preparations, at which point your curse returns to its basic state. At higher levels, you can grow to withstand your curse's major and even extreme effects, enabling you to cast more revelation spells without becoming overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>Your curse has the curse, divine, and necromancy traits. You can't mitigate, reduce, or remove the effects of your oracular curse by any means other than Refocusing and resting for 8 hours. For example, if your curse makes creatures @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from you, you can't negate that concealed condition through a magic item or spell, such as @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.Gb7SeieEvd0pL2Eh]{True Strike} (though you would still benefit from the other effects of that item or spell). Likewise, @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.OyFCwQuw8XRazsNr]{Remove Curse} and similar spells don't affect your curse at all.</p>\n<h2>Oracle Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain an oracle class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Signature Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Experience enables you to cast some spells more flexibly. For each spell level you have access to, choose one spell of that level to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-level versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can replace it with any spell you could have chosen when you first selected it (i.e., of the same spell level or lower). You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that level without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.<br /><br />At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>The intricacy of your divine power has grown clearer over time. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Major Curse<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better balance the conflicting powers wreaking havoc on your body. Immediately after completing the casting of a revelation spell while you are affected by your moderate curse, your curse progresses to its major effect, rather than overwhelming you. This effect lasts until you Refocus, which reduces your curse to its minor effect. If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of your major curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse.</p>\n<p>In addition, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool from 2 to 3. If you spend at least 2 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 2 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You truly understand the deep and complex divine power within your mystery. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Extreme Curse<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You have mastered a perilous balance between the conflicting divine powers of your mystery, gaining the power to change your fate, but straining both body and soul. When you cast a revelation spell while affected by your major curse, your curse intensifies to an extreme effect instead of overwhelming you. All mysteries share the same effects for their extreme curse.</p>\n<p>When affected by your extreme curse, you become @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.3uh1r86TzbQvosxv]{Doomed} 2 (or increase your doomed condition by 2 if you were already doomed). Once every 10 minutes, when you fail an attack roll, skill or Perception check, or saving throw, you can reroll it and use the second result. The reroll has the fortune trait and doesn't require you to spend an action, meaning you can use the reroll even if you can't act. These effects are in addition to all the effects of your major curse, and they can't be removed by any means until you Refocus to reduce your curse to its minor effect.</p>\n<p>If you cast a revelation spell while under the effects of this extreme curse, you are overwhelmed by your curse, and you remain doomed 2 even if you Refocus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you spend at least 3 Focus Points before you again Refocus, you recover 3 Focus Points when you Refocus instead of 1.</p>\n<h2>Greater Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your unbelievable training grants you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can harness divine power at a level few others can match. Your proficiency ranks for divine spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Oracular Clarity<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You now fully grasp the nature of the divine power behind your mystery, allowing you to work magic akin to miracles. Add two common 10th-level divine spells to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot you can use to cast one of those two spells using oracle spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, unlike other spell slots, and you can't use 10th-level slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.PExiZZTSP4p7TZaW]{Oracular Providence} feat to gain a second slot.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"oracle","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:23.615-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["cha"]},"items":{"2lr3d":{"id":"JQAujUXjczVnYDEI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","level":7,"name":"Resolve

After leaving the world in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to these ideals.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Valuing kindness and beauty, elves ever strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.</p>\n<p>Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. There's a physical element to this attunement, but it isn't only superficial. Elves who spend their lives among shorter‑lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans, either keeping a careful emotional distance or resigning yourself to outliving them.</li>\n<li>Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.</li>\n<li>Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.</li>\n<li>Assume you practice archery, cast spells, fight demons, and have perfected one or more fine arts.</li>\n<li>Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.</p>\n<p>Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.</p>\n<p>Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century, once they've experienced more, held several occupations, and outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They've since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.</p>\n<p>Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call ilduliel, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Many elves adventure to find beauty and discover new things. Typical backgrounds for an elf include emissary, hunter, noble, scholar, or scout. Elves often become rangers or rogues, taking advantage of their dexterity, or alchemists or wizards, exploring their intellectual curiosity.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue. They so commonly end in '-el' or '-ara' that other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables to avoid sounding too elven.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["elf","humanoid"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"elf","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:22.835-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"hp":6,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["con"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","elven"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["celestial","draconic","gnoll","gnomish","goblin","orcish","sylvan"],"custom":""},"items":{"1ptys":{"id":"DRtaqOHXTRtGRIUT","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/low-light-vision.webp","level":"1","name":"Low-Light Vision","pack":"pf2e.ancestryfeatures"}},"vision":"normal"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"KIwV5H1JfjRzcUlJ":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0"}}},{"_id":"Sw65FFICeZGDZDh6","name":"Otherworldly Magic","type":"feat","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/features/feats/feats.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your elven magic manifests as a simple arcane spell, even if you aren't formally trained in magic.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name &quot;stirge,&quot; possibly a corruption of the word &quot;scourge,&quot; comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal &quot;tools&quot; to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been &quot;blessed&quot; by the village's hungry god.<br /><br /> Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements.<br /><br /> Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a rogue class feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue's Racket</h2>\n<p>As you started on the path of the rogue, you began to develop your own style to pursue your illicit activities. Your racket shapes your rogue techniques and the way you approach a job, while building your reputation in the criminal underworld for a certain type of work. A client with deep pockets might even hire a team of rogues for a particular heist, each specializing in a different racket, in order to cover all the bases. Choose a rogue's racket.</p>\n<p>Rackets can be found here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.D8qtAo2w4jsqjBrM]{Eldritch Trickster Racket},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.RyOkmu0W9svavuAB]{Mastermind Racket},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.3KPZ7svIO6kmmEKH]{Ruffian Racket},</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZvfxtUMtfIOLYHyg]{Scoundrel Racket}, and</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.wAh2riuFRzz0edPl]{Thief Racket}</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Feats</h2>\n<p>You gain skill feats more often than others. At 1st level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Sneak Attack</h2>\n<p>When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, or a ranged weapon attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.</p>\n<p>As your rogue level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Surprise Attack</h2>\n<p>You spring into combat faster than foes can react. On the first round of combat, if you roll Deception or Stealth for initiative, creatures that haven't acted are flat-footed to you.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Deny Advantage<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>As someone who takes advantage of others' defenses, you are careful not to leave such openings yourself. You aren't flat-footed to hidden, undetected, or flanking creatures of your level or lower, or creatures of your level or lower using surprise attack. However, they can still help their allies flank.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Tricks<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become thoroughly familiar with the tools of your trade. You gain expert proficiency in simple weapons and unarmed attacks, as well as the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword. When you critically succeed at an attack roll against a flat-footed creature while using an agile or finesse simple weapon or any of the listed weapons, you apply the critical specialization effect for the weapon you're wielding.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragons' breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Debilitating Strikes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>When taking advantage of an opening, you both hinder and harm your foe. You gain the Debilitating Strike free action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.bp0Up04x3dzGK5bB]{Debilitating Strike} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You apply one of the following debilitations, which lasts until the end of your next turn. <br /><br /><strong>Debilitation</strong> The target takes a -10-foot status penalty to its Speeds.</p>\n<p><strong>Debilitation</strong> The target becomes enfeebled 1.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Great Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Rogue Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your techniques are now harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You elude danger to a degree that few can match. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Tricks<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've mastered a rogue's fighting moves. Your proficiency ranks increase to master for all simple weapons and unarmed attacks plus the rapier, sap, shortbow, and shortsword.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Double Debilitation<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your opportunistic attacks are particularly detrimental. When you use Debilitating Strike, you can apply two debilitations simultaneously; removing one removes both.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Slippery Mind<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You play mental games and employ cognitive tricks to throw off mind-altering effects. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Light Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p>\n<h2 class=\"title\">Master Strike<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can incapacitate an unwary foe with a single strike. Your proficiency rank for your rogue class DC increases to master. You gain the Master Strike free action.</p>\n<h3 class=\"title\">@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.Rlp7ND33yYfxiEWi]{Master Strike} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> Your Strike hits a flat-footed creature and deals damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The target attempts a Fortitude save at your class DC.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Your alignment must be one allowed by your deity, as listed in their entry. Your deity grants you the trained proficiency rank in one skill and with the deity's favored weapon. If the favored weapon is uncommon, you also get access to that weapon.</p>\n<p>Your deity also adds spells to your spell list. You can prepare these just like you can any spell on the divine spell list, once you can prepare spells of their level as a cleric. Some of these spells aren't normally on the divine list, but they're divine spells if you prepare them this way.</p>\n<p>A list of all deities can be found in the Deities compendium.</p>\n<h3><strong>Anathema</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's alignment or ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.</p>\n<p>If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, or if your alignment changes to one not allowed by your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your divine font and all divine spellcasting. These abilities can be regained only if you demonstrate your repentance by conducting an @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual.</p>\n<h2>Divine Font</h2>\n<p>Through your deity's blessing, you gain additional spells that channel either the life force called positive energy or its counterforce, negative energy. When you prepare your spells each day, you can prepare additional @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.rfZpqmj0AIIdkVIs]{Heal} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.wdA52JJnsuQWeyqz]{Harm} spells, depending on your deity. The divine font spell your deity provides is listed in the Divine Font entry for your deity; if both are listed, you can choose between <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em>. Once you choose, you can't change your choice short of an ethical shift or divine intervention.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Font</strong>: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>heal</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><strong>Harmful Font</strong>: You gain additional spell slots each day at your highest level of cleric spell slots. You can prepare only <em>harm</em> spells in these slots, and the number of slots is equal to 1 plus your Charisma modifier.</p>\n<h2>Divine Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Your deity bestows on you the power to cast divine spells. You can cast divine spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a cleric, you can usually hold a divine focus (such as a religious symbol) for spells requiring material components instead of needing to use a spell component pouch.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the common spells on the divine spell list in this book or from other divine spells to which you gain access. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a cleric, the number of spells you can prepare each day increases, as does the highest level of spell you can cast, as shown in Table 3-9: Cleric Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or your enemies to roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Wisdom, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a cleric. For example, as a 1st-level cleric, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level cleric, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3*</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*†</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* Your divine font gives you additional <em>heal</em> or <em>harm</em> spells of this level.

At 1st level, you select a doctrine and gain the benefits of its first doctrine. The doctrines presented in this book are cloistered cleric and warpriest. Each doctrine grants you initial benefits at 1st level. At 3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels, you gain the benefits granted by your doctrine's second, third, fourth, fifth, and final doctrines respectively.</p>\n<p>Doctrines can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZZzLMOUAtBVgV1DF]{Cloistered Cleric} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.0Aocw3igLwna9cjp]{Warpriest}).</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training, noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Cleric Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a cleric class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>You can use any of these skill increases you gain at 7th level or higher to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and any of these skill increases you gain at 15th level or higher to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Divine Defense<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your training and your deity protect you from harm. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Miraculous Spell<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You're exalted by your deity and gain truly incredible spells. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using divine spellcasting. You don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.QDjpZKOrWIV1G8XJ]{Maker of Miracles} feat to gain a second

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Your familiar gains an extra ability, and it gains an additional extra ability when you reach 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. Your connection with your familiar alters your arcane bond class feature so that you store your magical energy in your familiar, rather than an item you own; you also gain the Drain Familiar free action instead of Drain Bonded Item. Drain Familiar can be used any time an ability would allow you to use Drain Bonded Item and functions identically, except that you draw magic from your familiar instead of an item.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.89zWKD2CN7nRu2xp]{Metamagical Experimentation}</h2>\n<p>You've realized that the practice known as metamagic is a holdover from a time long ago, when wizards had to work out their own spells and variations rather than rely on spells recorded by others and passed down over the years. This allows you efficient access to various metamagic effects. You gain a 1st-level metamagic wizard feat as a bonus feat. Starting at 4th level, during your daily preparations, you can gain a metamagic wizard feat of your choice that has a level requirement of no more than half your level, which you can use until your next daily preparations.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.OAcxS625AXSGrQIC]{Spell Blending}</h2>\n<p>You theorize that spell slots are a shorthand for an underlying energy that powers all spellcasting, and you've found a way to tinker with the hierarchy of spell slots, combining them to fuel more powerful spells. When you make your daily preparations, you can trade two spell slots of the same level for a bonus spell slot of up to 2 levels higher than the traded spell slots. You can exchange as many spell slots as you have available. Bonus spell slots must be of a level you can normally cast, and each bonus spell slot must be of a different spell level. You can also trade any spell slot for two additional cantrips, though you cannot trade more than one spell slot at a time for additional cantrips in this way.</p>\n<h2>@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.QzWXMCSGNfvvpYgF]{Spell Substitution}</h2>\n<p>You don't accept the fact that once spells are prepared, they can't be changed until your next daily preparation, and you have uncovered a shortcut allowing you to substitute new spells for those you originally prepared. You can spend 10 minutes to empty one of your prepared spell slots and prepare a different spell from your spellbook in its place. If you are interrupted during such a swap, the original spell remains prepared and can still be cast. You can try again to swap out the spell later, but you must start the process over again.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["wizard"],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"arcane-thesis","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:23.655-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"level":{"value":1},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":""},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"dhpd4c0trfzh93gt"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":500000,"permission":{"default":0,"bL4m8T94kYDMr79h":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7"}}},{"_id":"dhpd4c0trfzh93gt","name":"Wizard","type":"class","img":"https://assets.forge-vtt.com/bazaar/systems/pf2e/assets/icons/classes/wizard.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>You are an eternal student of the arcane secrets of the universe, using your mastery of magic to cast powerful and devastating spells.

When enemies pull out tricks like @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.XXqE1eY3w3z6xJCB]{Invisibility} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.A2JfEKe6BZcTG1S8]{Fly}, you answer with spells like @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.0qaqksrGGDj74HXE]{Glitterdust} or @Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.gPvtmKMRpg9I9D7H]{Earthbind}, leveling the field for your allies.</p>\n<h2>During Social Encounters...</h2>\n<p>You provide a well of knowledge about arcane matters and solve arguments with logic.</p>\n<h2>While Exploring...</h2>\n<p>You locate magical auras and determine the arcane significance of magical writing or phenomena you uncover. When you run across an unusual obstacle to further exploration, you probably have a scroll that will make it easier to overcome.</p>\n<h2>In Downtime...</h2>\n<p>You learn new spells, craft magic items, or scribe scrolls for your party, and seek out new and exciting formulas in addition to spells. You might even forge scholarly connections and establish a school or guild of your own.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an unquenchable intellectual curiosity about how everything in the world around you works-magic in particular.</li>\n<li>Believe fervently that your school of magic is superior (if you're a specialist) or that true mastery of magic requires knowledge of all schools (if you're a universalist).</li>\n<li>Use esoteric jargon and technical terms to precisely describe the minutiae of magical effects, even though the difference is probably lost on other people.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider you to be incredibly powerful and potentially dangerous.</li>\n<li>Fear what your magic can do to their minds, bodies, and souls, and ask that you avoid casting spells in polite company, as few can identify whether one of your spells is harmless or malevolent until it's too late.</li>\n<li>Assume you can easily solve all their problems, from dangerous weather to poor crop yields, and ask you for spells that can help them get whatever they desire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Initial Proficiencies</h1>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain the listed proficiency ranks in the following statistics. You are untrained in anything not listed unless you gain a better proficiency rank in some other way.</p>\n<h2>Perception</h2>\n<p>Trained in Perception</p>\n<h2>Saving Throws</h2>\n<p>Trained in Fortitude<br />Trained in Reflex<br />Expert in Will</p>\n<h2>Skills</h2>\n<p>Trained in Arcana<br />Trained in a number of additional skills equal to 2 plus your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h2>Attacks</h2>\n<p>Trained in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, and staff<br />Trained in unarmed attacks</p>\n<h2>Defenses</h2>\n<p>Untrained in all armor<br />Trained in unarmored defense</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>Trained in arcane spell attacks<br />Trained in arcane spell DCs</p>\n<h1>Class Features</h1>\n<p>You gain these features as a Wizard.

Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Drain Bonded Item} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day<br /><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</p>\n<h2>Arcane School</h2>\n<p>Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.</p>\n<p>Arcane schools can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gCwcys8CnS102tji]{Arcane School: Abjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SNeVaUBTHwvoO6kr]{Arcane School: Conjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.yobGgrHdgjs5QW5o]{Arcane School: Divination}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHwGACWQEy6kTzcP]{Arcane School: Enchantment}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibhml5y20g5M3Vgd]{Arcane School: Evocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.K6hG7nH8yjmbA0Q9]{Arcane School: Illusion}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uNM7qZQokRKAEd7k]{Arcane School: Necromancy}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.rHxkPijLnQ9O9AGV]{Arcane School: Transmutation} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qczCKdg47eAmCOUD]{Arcane School: Universalist})</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3-19: Wizard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Crimson Libram</em>, or something more academic, like <em>A Field Study in Practical Transmutation</em>.<br /><br />Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The Archwizard's Spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Arcane Thesis</h2>\n<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like \"On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.\"</p>\n<p>Arcane thesis can be found here @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7]{Arcane Thesis}.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through a combination of magic and training, you've learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Archwizard's Spellcraft<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tP26mgaFPpr6df1i]{Archwizard's Might} feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive understanding of both arcane theory and practical spellcraft. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to legendary.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":{"value":"common"},"custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"wizard","schema":{"version":0.642,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2021-07-03T22:03:23.631-05:00","version":{"schema":null}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["int"]},"items":{"4x1uf":{"id":"1NGTc0gqEtwaFqUK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon
